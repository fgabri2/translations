en:  "The compound bow is slightly better than the bow, but doesn't exceed the crossbow in dealing torpor. Therefore it is not the most efficient bow for taming.",
it:  "L'arco composito è leggermente migliore dell'arco standard, ma non supera la balestra nell'infliggere torpore. Per questo non è l'arco più efficiente per il taming",
en:  "The boomerang can be used to knockout creatures from a distance, without using ammo. If the Boomerang hits a target, it will fly straight back to you. If you miss, it will return by flying back to your counter-clockwise.",
it:  "Il boomerang può essere usato per stordire le creature dalla distanza senza usare munizioni. Se il boomerang colpisce il bersaglio, tornerà immediatamente indietro a voi. Se mancate il bersaglio il boomerang tornerà indietro finendo il giro.",
en:  "The longneck rifle can make use of the new tranquilizer darts to knock out enemies. Currently, these are one of the best weapons to apply torpor to a creature.",
it:  "Il fucile a canna lunga può fare uso dei dardi tranquillanti per stordire i nemici. Attualmente, questa è una della armi migliori per applicare torpore ad una creatura.",
en:  "The longneck rifle can make use of the new shocking tranquilizer darts to knock out enemies. These do twice as much torpor damage as the regular darts, but will spoil after 4 hours.",

en:  "The electric prod is the latest addition to the ARK. It does a massive amount of torpor damage and no damage to health. This makes it a perfect device for knocking out creatures for taming. Note that the weapon is single-use, so you might need multiple prods to knock out larger creatures.",
it:  "Il pungolo elettrico è l'ultima aggiunta ad ARK. Infligge un grande ammontare di torpore e non danneggia la salute. Questo lo rende perfetto per stordire le creature da tamare. Ricorda che l'arma è ad uso singolo, quindi ti serviranno un maggior numero di questi oggetti per stordire grandi creature.",
en:  "The club can be used to knock out your opponent and is based on both your melee damage and the damage percentage of the club itself. You can input your character's melee damage on the settings page of the app.",
it:  "La clava puù essere usata per stordire i tuoi avversari e si basa sul tuo danno fisico e sulla percentuale di danno della clava stessa. Puoi inserire il danno fisico del tuo personaggio nella pagina delle impostazioni dell'app.",
en:  "Your fists (and the wooden club) are the only 'weapons' that will be influenced by your own melee damage, since it is not a projectile. Make sure you set your melee damage on the settings page.",
it:  "I tuoi pugni (e la clava di legno) sono le uniche "armi" influenzate dal tuo danno fisico, dato che non utilizzano proiettili. Assicurati di inserire il tuo danno fisico nella pagina delle impostazioni",
en:  "The scorpion applies torpor to its target in a timespan of 10 seconds. In between these 10 seconds, you are not able to apply torpor to the target again. If you decide to attack a target while these 10 seconds are not over yet, you will only inflict normal damage and no torpor damage.",
it:  "Lo scorpione applica torpore al suo bersaglio in un lasso di tempo di 10 secondi. In questi 10 secondi non potrai applicare ulteriore torpore allo stesso bersaglio. Se attaccherai ugualmete il bersaglio durante questi 10 secondi, infliggerai solo danno alla salute.",
en:  "The Arthropluera's main attack deals torpor damage and can therefore be used for taming. However, the torpor is applied to the target in a timespan of 10 seconds and the torpor attacks do not stack in this case. The Arthropluera is slightly better than the scorpion for knocking creatures out.",
it:  "L'attacco principale dell'Arthroplurea applica torpore e può essere usato per il taming. Come per lo scorpione, il torpore è aoolicato in un tempo di 10 secondi e il torpore non viene accumulato. L'Arthroplurea è leggermente migliore dello scorpione per stordire le creature.",
en:  "Much like the scorpion, the Beelzebufo applies torpor to its target in a timespan of 10 seconds. In between these 10 seconds, you are not able to apply torpor to the target again. If you decide to attack a target while these 10 seconds are not over yet, you will only inflict normal damage and no torpor damage. Furthermore, the Beelzebufo has two types of attacks which do different amounts of torpor damage. The left mousebutton attack (shoot out tonque) will result in less torpor damage, and is denoted by the maximum amount of licks you will need. Alternatively, the right mousebutton attack (tonque swing) is denoted by the minimum amount of licks.",
it:  "Proprio come lo scorpione, il Beelzebufo applica tirpore al suo nemici in un intervallo di tempo di 10 secondi.in questi secondi, non sarà possibile applicare ulteriore torpore. Se deciderai di attacare un bersaglio durante questi 10 secondi,infliggerai solo danno e non torpore. Inoltre, il Beelzebufo ha due tipi di attacco che infliggono quantità diverse di torpore. Il tasto sinistro del mouse(lancia fuori frontalmente la lingua)infliggerà meno torpore. In alternativa, il tasto destro del mouse (frustata con la lingua) è nota per il numero minore di attacchi necessari",
en:  "The pachy has two kinds of attacks, charged and non-charged, that both do instant torpor damage to the target. The charged attack, indicated by the minimum amount of blows, does much more torpor damage than the non-charged attack, however the attack is hard to steer in the right direction.",
it:  "Il pachy ha due tipi di attaco, caricato e non-caricato, entrambi recano torpore instantaneo al bersaglio. L' attacco caricato, infligge molto più torpore rispetto al non-caricato, anche se è molto più difficile direzionare correttamente l ' attacco",

//Timer explanation
en:  "Why starve taming?",
it:  "",
en:  "To get things straight: starve taming does not have any influence on the total time your tame will take. Instead, it is mostly used to minimize risk on important tames. The advantage of starve taming is that you don't use food yet, meaning that you can leave a tame if it for instance gets hit (and the effectiveness gets lowered), without losing your precious kibble.",
it:  "",
en:  "How does the starve timer work?",
it:  "",
en:  "First, make sure you have selected the right creature, level and food you are using for the tame.",
it:  "",
en:  "Fill in the max food stat of the creature you have knocked unconscious in the 'Max food' field",
it:  "",
en:  "Fill in the current food value of the creature, keep in mind that this can go down pretty quickly.",
it:  "",
en:  "Optionally; set an alarm by checking the box and setting a value when you want to be noticed. Tip: make sure you will have enough time to get back to your game when you hear the alarm.",
it:  "",
en:  "Press start to start the timer. You can also leave the app (and even kill it), as the timer will work in the background in those cases.",
it:  "",
en:  "What does the target food indicate?",
it:  "",
en:  "Some creatures will not have a high enough food stat to be fully starved. If that is the case, the target food will be negative and indicate that, when its food has reached 0, can not be tamed in one go. If this is the case, the starve timer will count down until the food has reached 0. If the creature has a high enough food stat, the target food value will indicate when the creature has lost enough food to eat everything in one go. If you've then reached this target value, fill the creature up and watch it eat everything until tamed!",
it:  "",
en:  "How does the narcotic timer work?",
it:  "",
en:  "Simply put, the narcotic timer counts down from the given torpor amount until 0. You only have to fill in the creature's current torpor and press start for it to work.",
it:  "",
en:  "Tip: Make sure to set the alarm in a way that you will be able to reach the creature in time; it WILL wake up if it reaches 0.",
it:  "",
en:  "What do the icons above the timer mean?",
it:  "",
en:  "You can toggle between the use of narcotics and narcoberries by using the icons above the timer. This will change the indications of the amount and time needed to fully refill the creature's torpor.",

If you are playing on an official server, you don't have to make any changes as the app now defaults to these new \"2x rates\". However, if you're playing on a server with boosted settings, please go to Settings > Server settings and add your custom server with the new corresponding rates.",
